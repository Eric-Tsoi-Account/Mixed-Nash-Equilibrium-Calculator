# Mixed Nash Equilibrium Calculator
 I rediscovered this tiny project when I was organizing some old files on my computer. It is a program that attempts to calculate the corresponding probabilities of players adopting different strategies based on the payoff matrix of a two players non-cooperative game. I used Electron to develop it. The code was written a long time ago, so I'm not so sure whether the math I used at that time is correct. Still, it's a fun project.

Just install electron, cd your way into the folder, and run `electron ./main.js` to enjoy.
